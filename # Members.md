### FAQ

Q: What is the purpose of this product?

A: Aromex Air is a specialized aroma disinfectant company dedicated to curbing the transmission of airborne microbes and eradicating unwanted odors in vehicles, commercial spaces, and homes.

Q: How long does a 100ML snd 500ml blended scents last?

A: We recommend using it sparingly with water (avoid using tap water). Our car diffusers offer three modes: the blue setting provides a continuous flow, the pink setting is intermittent (recommended for oil conservation), and the red setting turns off the diffuser. With a 500ML refill, you can expect it to last 2-3 months.

For home or vehicle diffusion, running the diffuser for 10 minutes to an hour (depending on the area size) is typically sufficient to disinfect and refresh your space. When used daily as directed, one refill should last around 3-4 weeks.

Q: Which fragrances do you recommend for lighter scents?

A: For milder scents, we recommend Lavender Mist, Fruit Blend, Blue Dream, Pink Rose, Lemon Rain, and Botanical Blend.

Q: Which fragrances do you recommend for stronger scents?

A: If you prefer heavier scents, we suggest trying Malibu Evergreen, Cool Breeze, Royalty, Cherry, and Green Clover.

Q: Can this product be directly applied to surfaces by pouring or wiping?

A: No, we strongly advise against wiping, spraying, or pouring the solutions directly onto any surface.

Q: How should I maintain my diffuser?

A: To ensure your diffuser operates smoothly, we recommend periodically cleaning the filter (particularly for USB diffusers) with warm water, ensuring you squeeze out excess water before reinserting it. More comprehensive instructions can be found in the provided manual.

For home and office diffusers, it's advisable to clean the interior using a warm, clean cloth every third use. We also recommend starting with just a capful of our scent for the initial use. On the second and third uses, we suggest adding only water to help disperse any excess oil within the diffuser. If you opt to add oil for each use, it's essential to wipe the diffuser with a warm, clean cloth before adding fresh water and a capful of our scent. This practice ensures the longevity of your diffuser.

Q: Can I use other oils in the diffuser?

A: While we highly recommend using Aromex Air products, as they are specifically blended to optimize the diffuser's performance and reduce the risk of clogs, you can use our oils in your diffuser if it is made of glass, ceramic, metal, or corrosion-resistant plastic.

Q: Is this product safe for use around children and pets?

A: For children, we recommend Lavender Mist, Evergreen, and Lemon Rain. If you have cats, consider using Royalty and Lavender Mist. For dogs, we suggest Lavender Mist, Lemon Rain, and Royalty.

Q: Is this product safe to use around pregnant women?

A: We strongly advise pregnant women to consult with their healthcare provider before using any essential oils.

Q: Can Aromex Air solutions be used in other diffusers?

A: Yes, you can use Aromex Air solutions in other diffusers, but it's important to ensure that the diffuser is designed for essential oils and is made of glass, metal, ceramic, or BPA-free plastic.

Q: Is it necessary to dilute Aromex Air solutions with water before using them?

A: Yes, we recommend adding water (excluding tap water) to the diffuser first, and then adding a capful of our blended scents or a few drops of organic essential oils.
